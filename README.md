# Your Own RSS Feed

This is a website created for [Webcomic Day 2023](https://webcomicday.com/) that explains how people can edit and use an RSS Feed Reader extension I built for the holiday.

You can view the website [here](diyrss.neocities.org) and check out the extension itself [here]().

Special thanks to the [Screen Tones podcast](https://twitter.com/ScreenTonesCast) for hosting the day, and thank you to [Heyfonts](https://heyfonts.gumroad.com/) for Mahogany- it looks great on this site.
