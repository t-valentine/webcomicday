						What's Webcomic Day?
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Webcomic Day</strong> is hosted by the Screen Tones podcast
						and aims to celebrate all things webcomic-related! From fans to
						creators- it's a day for everyone to celebrate, share, and talk
						about webcomics!
					</p>
					<p>
						You can learn more about it by visiting the
						<a href="https://webcomicday.com/" target="_blank">
							Webcomic Day website
						</a>
						or check out the <strong>#webcomicday</strong> hashtag on your
						favorite social media.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						To me, the artistic and creative spirit that goes into webcomics is
						just as important as the <strong>DIY</strong> aspect of it- lots of
						people have story ideas and very few people feel they can tell those
						stories themselves. (Not that webcomics are easy to make or an
						effortless endeavor- but like all DIY projects, they reward those
						who are willing to try!)
					</p>
					<h3>What the humble RSS feed can do for <em>You</em></h3>
					<p>
						As social media sites become more fraught, following your favorite
						creators has become more difficult. If someone posts a page off
						schedule, or needs to take a hiatus, that information can be lost
						among ads and bad algorithms.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's where RSS Feeds come in! (If you want to know more,
						<a
							href="https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/"
							target="_blank">
							RSS.com has a great explanatory article
						</a>
						.) A lot of webcomics you follow probably have their own RSS feeds
						already- just look for the
						<img src="./src/images/rss-feed-symbol.png" style="height: 15px" />
						icon. Using the RSS Feed Link, you can follow and be alerted to new
						pages from your favorite webcomic creators. (Or, if you follow
						authors, they often also have RSS feeds built into their blogs and
						websites.)
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3>CIY (Code It Yourself)</h3>
				<p>
					There’s lots of pre-built browser extensions that allow you to track
					RSS Feeds- but in the spirit of DIY and Webcomic Day-
					<strong>
						here is a RSS Feed Reader Extension you can download and edit and
						chop up to your heart’s content!
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Did you know a browser extension really only uses HTML and CSS
					(especially after I’ve done all the JavaScript coding work)? So even
					someone with very limited coding knowledge can customize their own
					extension.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can hop right down to the code to download and starting messing
					around- <em>or</em> you can read
					<a href="#intro"> the introduction to coding</a> blurb below.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2 class="section-header" id="code">Your RSS Feed Reader</h2>
			<div class="spacing">
				<h3>Download</h3>
				<p>You can download the extension here!</p>
				<p>
					Click the green 'Code' button and click 'Download ZIP.' Once the zip
					file is downloaded, you can unzip it and begin editing!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're worried about downloading something online, the extension is
					hosted on Github, so all the files you download are visible on Github
					before putting them on your computer. Feel free to look through the
					code- because this is a <em>public</em> repository, people can leave
					comments about the nature of what they've downloaded too.
				</p>
				<h3>Editing and Installation Instructions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Find the file named ‘script.js’ and right click the file, then
							click ‘Open with’ and select your Text Editor of choice. All
							images below show the code as viewed in Notepad. It should look
							like this:
						</p>
						<img src="./src/images/notepad1.png" style="width: 350px" />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Go to your favorite webcomic, find their RSS Feed, and copy the
							URL in the browser. Once you click on the link, the page will look
							like a block of text. That’s okay, that’s the RSS Feed! The code
							in this extension takes that big block of code, and turns it into
							something that’s easier to read.
						</p>
						<img src="./src/images/rss3.png" style="width: 350px" />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Paste the URL into the list (you can delete the links that are
							already there). Make sure to put quotation marks around the link,
							and to place a comma at the end as well. Like this:
							<code style="background-color: white"> "link", </code>
						</p>
						<img src="./src/images/notepad4.png" style="width: 350px" />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Click save! You’ve officially customized your own RSS Feed reader!
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									If you want, you can also edit index.html and style.css to
									change the colors and formatting of the browser extension. I
									wouldn’t recommend editing background.js- that file handles
									showing you a notification badge when a webcomic has updated.
									(The color of the badge can be changed in style.css)
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Installing your extension has different steps depending on the
							browser you use. The steps below are for Firefox, but you can
							follow
							<a
								href="https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/install-a-chrome-extension/"
								target="_blank">
								these steps to download it on Chrome
							</a>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									I only tested the extension on Firefox and Chrome, so the
									extension may not work as intended on other browsers. If you
									use another browser like Safari or Opera, you can google and
									follow steps to add your own extension. Let me know how it
									works!
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Click on the Menu button and then select ‘Extensions & Themes’ or
							press CTRL + Shift + A
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Click the Gear Icon the the right of ‘Manage Your Extensions’ and
							click ‘Install Add-on from file…’ from the menu
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Select the WHAT FILE HUH WHAT from the folder- your browser uses
							the location of the file, so if you move it, you’ll need to
							re-install it.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You’re done! You can pin the extension to your Toolbar, and get
							notifications whenever a webcomic you like updates.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					If you want to customize the look of the extension, or later add more
					RSS Feeds to track, you’ll need to WHAT so that way the extension on
					your browser is updated.
				</p>

				But, I Don't Know Anything About Coding!
			</h2>
			<div class="spacing">
				<p>
					That’s okay! I’ve made the code extremely painless, once you download
					the files, you’ll only need to take a couple steps to customize and
					add the extension to your browser. I’ve written comments in the code
					so it’s super clear what you (someone with little coding experience)
					can edit, and also I’ve written what you shouldn’t touch. If you break
					something, you can always redownload the file and start from a working
					extension again.
				</p>
				<h3>Coding and the Web</h3>
				<p>
					The browser extension uses HTML (creates content and structure), CSS
					(styles the content with colors and more), and JavaScript (lets the
					user interact with the content). Coincidentally, these 3 coding
					languages are also the building blocks of (almost) all websites you
					use, which means you only need to learn the basics of web development
					to understand how to edit this RSS Feed Reader (and make your own
					website, if you want).
				</p>
				<p>
					There is only 1 specific place you have to edit the JavaScript, and
					it’s explained in detail below. The rest of customization can be done
					solely with HTML and CSS (and is 100% optional). The place where you
					need to edit the code is explicitly pointed out, and I go into depth
					explaining that in the download section too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your computer probably has a built-in Text Editor (like Notepad on
					Windows computers), and you can use that for the most basic
					customization (adding webcomics you want to follow). If you’re
					interested in customizing the extension’s appearance, then I’d
					recommend downloading a Text Editor specific for coding. I’ve included
					some tutorials below that explain the basics of HTML and CSS- the
					tutorials will also give you advice on which text editor is right for
					you. (I use VS Code, but that's mainly because I use it for work.)

				<h3>Wait, I'm Stil Confused About RSS Feeds!</h3>
				<p>
					RSS stands for Really Simply Syndication (or Rich Site Summary) and
					has been around since the 1990s. RSS is less popular now than it was
					in the past, but since it’s an older technology, a lot of websites
					have an RSS feed built into them automatically.
				</p>
				<p>
					An RSS feed is a simple text file written in a coding language called
					XML. When you have a website with an RSS Feed, any changes to your
					website are reflected in the RSS file immediately. An RSS Feed by
					itself is just code, and can look really intimidating. Even if you’re
					familiar with code, it still isn’t the easiest thing to read. An RSS
					Feed Reader takes the code, and turns it into something that’s easier
					for a user to read.
				</p>
				<p>
					With social media and email on the rise, RSS Feeds became less
					popular. When I was in high school, I used an RSS Feed to keep track
					of when manga I read updated (and when sites I liked to visit, liked
					Cracked, published new articles). Now, I think most people rely solely
					on social media and email newsletters to see when their favorite
					websites update.
				</p>
				<p>
					RSS feeds are unique, because there’s no middle-man. There’s no email
					server to set up or social media presence to manage for the website
					owner, and on your end, you won’t find a newsletter in your spam or
					miss a Tweet because it got “low engagement.” When the website
					updates, the RSS updates, and your Feed Reader updates. That’s it.
				</p>
				<h3>My Soapbox</h3>
				<p>
					Maybe this is unrelated, but I truly feel like most technology is
					actually a lot more accessible than people realize. Even if the
					thought of coding something is intimidating, I still encourage you to
					check out the steps to editing and setting up the extension, and see
					what would go into editing the browser extension. There are a lot of
					great resources for learning to code, and it’s honestly like any other
					hobby. You don’t have to be “good” to have fun and make stuff for
					yourself and your friends.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2 class="section-header" id="extras">
				I Want to Know More About the Code!
			</h2>
			<div class="spacing">
				<p>
					My GitHub readme has some basic information about the extension- if
					you’re more code savvy you could edit and publish the extension only
					using the readme and comments in the code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Below is some additional information about how the code works, and a
					little bit about my thoughts behind certain design choices. If you
					disagree or think you could do something better- feel free! I’m
					<em> sure </em> there’s a way to make every line of code more
					efficient and more elegant.
				</p>
				<h3>General Design</h3>
				<p>
					I only wanted the most recent update visible in the extension- mainly
					because there isn’t a backend so there’s no way for you to ‘delete’ an
					RSS update and have that stay deleted every time you open the
					extension. Also, I thought only having the most recent update would
					keep the extension from getting cluttered if you followed multiple
					webcomics.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also chose to populate the information into a table- both of these
					are things someone with coding experience could change and mess around
					with. Whether changing if the RSS populates into a p element rather
					than a table, or loading more than one update per webcomic. Go wild-
					honestly- and then show me!
				</p>
				<h3>CORS</h3>
				<p>
					Ah, CORS. This was the first big hurdle when I was creating the RSS
					Feed Reader. (For those who may not know: CORS stands for Cross Origin
					Resource Sharing, and protects a website’s assets. This includes an
					RSS feed. Some sites allow an external RSS Feed Reader to access the
					RSS Feed, some don’t. All the webcomic RSS feeds I tried to access
					didn’t let me access them. Very irritating.
				</p>
				<p>
					However! After some research, I found
					<a href="https://corsproxy.io/" target="_blank">corsproxy.io</a> It
					fixes and resolves the CORS errors I was seeing, and is very easy to
					implement in your own work. Honestly, I’m not 100% sure how it works
					or who made it- clicking through the site, it appears to me from a
					German company. But it works!
