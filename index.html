						What's Webcomic Day?
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Webcomic Day</strong> is hosted by the Screen Tones podcast
						and aims to celebrate all things webcomic-related! From fans to
						creators- it's a day for everyone to celebrate, share, and talk
						about webcomics!
					</p>
					<p>
						You can learn more about it by visiting the
						<a href="https://webcomicday.com/" target="_blank">
							Webcomic Day website
						</a>
						or check out the <strong>#webcomicday</strong> hashtag on your
						favorite social media.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						To me, the artistic and creative spirit that goes into webcomics is
						just as important as the <strong>DIY</strong> aspect of it- lots of
						people have story ideas and very few people feel they can tell those
						stories themselves. (Not that webcomics are easy to make or an
						effortless endeavor- but like all DIY projects, they reward those
						who are willing to try!)
					</p>
					<h3>What the humble RSS feed can do for <em>You</em></h3>
					<p>
						As social media sites become more fraught, following your favorite
						creators has become more difficult. If someone posts a page off
						schedule, or needs to take a hiatus, that information can be lost
						among ads and bad algorithms.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's where RSS Feeds come in! (If you want to know more,
						<a
							href="https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/"
							target="_blank">
							RSS.com has a great explanatory article
						</a>
						.) A lot of webcomics you follow probably have their own RSS feeds
						already- just look for the
						<img src="./src/images/rss-feed-symbol.png" style="height: 15px" />
						icon. Using the RSS Feed Link, you can follow and be alerted to new
						pages from your favorite webcomic creators. (Or, if you follow
						authors, they often also have RSS feeds built into their blogs and
						websites.)
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="spacing">
				<h3>CIY (Code It Yourself)</h3>
				<p>
					There’s lots of pre-built browser extensions that allow you to track
					RSS Feeds- but in the spirit of DIY and Webcomic Day-
					<strong>
						here is a RSS Feed Reader Extension you can download and edit and
						chop up to your heart’s content!
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Did you know a browser extension really only uses HTML and CSS
					(especially after I’ve done all the JavaScript coding work)? So even
					someone with very limited coding knowledge can customize their own
					extension.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can hop right down to the code to download and start messing
					around- <em>or</em> you can read the section below for an introduction
					to coding.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2 class="section-header" id="intro">
				But, I Don't Know Anything About Coding!
			</h2>
			<div class="spacing">
				<p>
					That’s okay! I’ve made the code extremely painless, once you download
					the files, you’ll only need to take a couple of steps to customize and
					add the extension to your browser. I’ve written comments in the code
					so it’s super clear what you (someone with little coding experience)
					can edit, and also I’ve written what you shouldn’t touch. If you break
					something, you can always re-download the file and start from a
					working extension again.
				</p>
				<h3>Coding and the Web</h3>
				<p>
					The browser extension uses HTML (creates content and structure), CSS
					(styles the content with colors and more), and JavaScript (lets the
					user interact with the content). Coincidentally, these 3 coding
					languages are also the building blocks of (almost) all websites you
					use, which means you only need to learn the basics of web development
					to understand how to edit this RSS Feed Reader (and make your own
					website, if you want).
				</p>
				<p>
					There is only 1 specific place you have to edit the JavaScript, and
					it’s explained in detail below. The rest of the customization can be
					done solely with HTML and CSS (and is 100% optional). The place where
					you need to edit the code is explicitly pointed out, and I go into
					depth explaining that in the download section too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your computer probably has a built-in Text Editor (like Notepad on
					Windows computers), and you can use that for the most basic
					customization (adding webcomics you want to follow). If you’re
					interested in customizing the extension’s appearance, then I’d
					recommend downloading a Text Editor specific for coding. I’ve included
					some tutorials below that explain the basics of HTML and CSS- the
					tutorials will also give you advice on which text editor is right for
					you. (I use VS Code, but that's mainly because I use it for work.)
				</p>

						coding, I'd recommend starting with one of the others.)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="anatomy">Anatomy of an Extension</h3>
				<p>
					Before we start, there’s some basic vocabulary and architecture we
					should go over. First, let’s look at what you’ll see when the
					extension is working. Then, we’ll go over the files you’ll see in the
					ZIP folder, and which ones you should keep an eye on if you want to
					edit your extension.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want more detailed information about what each file does, you
					can click on the ‘README.md’ file and learn more! Or read about it on
					the Github page (which is linked in the
					<a href="#code">‘Download’</a> section of this site.)
				</p>
				<div class="anatomy-div">
					<div>
						<h4 style="margin-top: 0">What the Extension Will Look Like</h4>
						<img
							src="./src/images/anatomy.png"
							class="tutorial-images"
							id="anatomy-pic" />
					</div>
					<div>
						<h4 style="margin-top: 0">Folder Structure of the Extension</h4>
						<img src="./src/images/filestructure.png" />
					</div>
				</div>
				<h4>Files Of Interest</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							The <strong>img folder</strong> has the icon that appears in your
							browser, the icon itself is called <em>icon48.png</em> and comes
							from
							<a
								href="https://icons8.com/icon/68819/edit-image"
								target="_blank">
								Icons8
							</a>
							(which is a great resource, if you want a different icon). The
							icon itself is 48 x 48 pixels. Technically, it's good practice to
							have multiple sizes of your icon, but since this is just something
							we're doing for fun, it's only got one size.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you want the icon in your Bookmarks Toolbar to look different,
							choose a different 48 x 48 picture and save it to the img folder
							as ‘icon48.png’.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>background.js </strong> runs in the background and creates
							a badge if a comic updates today. This is where you'll add the RSS
							Feed links of comics you want to follow - this is the
							<strong>only</strong> file you have to edit to customize your
							extension. This is also where you set what the badge's color and
							contents, if you want to change that.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>style.css</strong> is what styles your popup- this is
							where you get to change the color, the font, the size of the font,
							et cetera. I've left comments outlining what everything does.
							Don't be afraid to experiment! If you really mess something up,
							you can just start back over from the original styling.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					That's it! See, there really isn't too much to customize, and even
					less if you just want to add your own favorite comics.
				</p>
				<h3>Wait, I'm Stil Confused About RSS Feeds!</h3>
				<p>
					RSS stands for Really Simply Syndication (or Rich Site Summary) and
					has been around since the 1990s. RSS is less popular now than it was
					in the past, but since it’s an older technology, a lot of websites
					have an RSS feed built into them automatically.
				</p>
				<p>
					An RSS feed is a simple text file written in a coding language called
					XML. When you have a website with an RSS Feed, any changes to your
					website are reflected in the RSS file immediately. An RSS Feed by
					itself is just code and can look really intimidating. Even if you’re
					familiar with code, it still isn’t the easiest thing to read. An RSS
					Feed Reader takes the code and turns it into something that’s easier
					to read.
				</p>
				<p>
					With social media and email on the rise, RSS Feeds became less
					popular. When I was in high school, I used an RSS Feed to keep track
					of when manga I read updated (and when sites I liked to visit, like
					Cracked, published new articles). Now, I think most people rely solely
					on social media and email newsletters to see when their favorite
					websites update.
				</p>
				<p>
					RSS feeds are unique because there’s no middle-man. There’s no email
					server to set up or social media presence to manage for the website
					owner, and on your end, you won’t find a newsletter in your spam or
					miss a Tweet because it got “low engagement.” When the website
					updates, the RSS updates, and your Feed Reader updates. That’s it.
				</p>
				<h3>My Soapbox</h3>
				<p>
					Maybe this is unrelated, but I truly feel like most technology is
					actually a lot more accessible than people realize. Even if the
					thought of coding something is intimidating, I still encourage you to
					check out the steps to editing and setting up the extension, and see
					what would go into editing the browser extension. There are a lot of
					great resources for learning to code and it’s honestly like any other
					hobby. You don’t have to be “good” to have fun and make stuff for
					yourself and your friends. (Just like webcomics!)

				<h3>Download</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="https://github.com/t-valentine/diy-rss" target="_blank">
						You can download the extension here!
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Click the green 'Code' button and click 'Download ZIP.' Once the zip
					file is downloaded, you can unzip it and begin editing!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're worried about downloading something online, the extension is
					hosted on Github, so all the files you download are visible on Github
					before putting them on your computer. Feel free to click through and
					see what each file has in it before downloading.
				</p>
				<p>
					I only tested the extension on Firefox and Chrome, so the extension
					may not work as intended on other browsers. If you use another browser
					like Safari or Opera, you can google and follow steps to add your own
					extension. Let me know how it works!
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Editing and Installation Instructions</h3>
				<ol>
					<h4>Making Your First Edit</h4>
					<li>
						<p>
							Find the 'background' folder and select the JavaScript file based
							on the browser you use. So if you use Firefox, select Firefox.js.
							Right click that file, then click ‘Open with’ and select your Text
							Editor of choice. All images below show the code as viewed in
							Notepad. It should look like this:
						</p>
						<img src="./src/images/notepad1.png" class="tutorial-images" />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Go to your favorite webcomic, find their RSS Feed, and copy the
							URL in the browser. Once you click on the link, the page will look
							like a block of text. That’s okay, that’s the RSS Feed! The code
							in this extension takes that big block of code, and turns it into
							something that’s easier to read.
						</p>
						<img src="./src/images/rss2.png" class="tutorial-images" />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Paste the URL into the list (you can delete the links that are
							already there). Make sure to put quotation marks around the link,
							and to place a comma at the end as well. Like this:
							<code style="background-color: white"> "link", </code>
						</p>
						<img src="./src/images/notepad4.png" class="tutorial-images" />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Click save! You’ve officially customized your own RSS Feed reader!
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>If you use Chrome</strong> this extension was built
									with Mozilla Firefox in mind. So you still have two more
									things to do before you can use the extension. It's just two
									simple changes, and all you do is change the word 'mozilla' to
									'chrome'.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									In the <strong>manifest.json</strong> file, change line 9 so
									that it reads
									<code style="background-color: white">
										"scripts": ["background/chrome.js"],
									</code>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									In the <strong>rss.html</strong> file, change line 13 so that
									it says
									<code style="background-color: white">
										src="background/chrome.js"
									</code>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You need to now "package" your extension- which is a fancy way of
							saying you need to put some files into a ZIP folder so the browser
							can read the extension correctly.
						</p>
						<p>Compress the following files:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the background folder</li>
							<li>the img folder</li>
							<li>manifest.json</li>
							<li>rss.html</li>
							<li>script.js</li>
							<li>style.css</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							(You want to compress everything but the License, the README, and
							a .git folder if you have one.)
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have a <strong>Windows</strong> computer, select those
							files, right click and select
							<strong> Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder</strong>. <br />
							If you have a Mac, you'll select
							<strong>Compress 6 items</strong>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<h4>Installing Your Extension</h4>
					<li>
						<p>
							Installing your extension has different steps depending on the
							browser you use, but it's fairly simple to do in both Firefox and
							Chrome. The steps below are for Firefox, and the aside below is
							for Chrome.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>If you use Chrome</strong> as long as you made the
									edits I specified in step 4, go to
									<em>chrome://extensions/ </em> and drag the ZIP folder onto
									the page. It should load automatically from there.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									If you're a Chromer user you will see 2 errors upon uploading
									your application. These errors will not affect the app's
									functionality, and are around 1. the app being built for
									Firefox and 2. the Manifest version I used for the json file.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<h1 style="color: red">
						Steps 7 and 8 may get removed if Mozilla signs my extension before
						Webcomics day
					</h1>
					<li>
						<p>
							In Firefox, go to <strong>about:config</strong> in your browser
							and click 'Accept the Risk.' This will bring you to a page where
							you can edit some important things for your browser. Only edit
							what I mention, and be careful messing around here too much.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Search for <strong>xpinstall.signatures.required</strong> in the
							search bar, and double click to make the preference 'false'.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Click on the Menu button next to your Bookmarks Toolbar and then
							select ‘Extensions & Themes’ or press CTRL + Shift + A
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Click the Gear Icon the the right of ‘Manage Your Extensions’ and
							click ‘Install Add-on from file…’ from the menu. Then select the
							ZIP folder you previously made.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You’re done! You can pin the extension to your Toolbar, and get
							notifications whenever a webcomic you like updates.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<div id="you-did-it">
					<h3 style="text-align: center">It's that easy!</h3>
					<p style="text-align: center">
						You know have your very own, customized, RSS Feed Reader.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Updating Your RSS Feed Reader</h3>
				<p>
					Well, you've done it! But maybe, you want the extension to be green
					and the icon to be a big star instead of a painting. Or maybe you want
					to add a new podcast to your reader. (Did you know podcasts also have
					RSS feeds you can track?) Well, open up the code and make those
					changes! If you want to see the changes you make in real time, follow
					the steps below in 'Seeing Your Edits.'
				</p>
				<p>
					For those who are less code savvy, I've added comments explaining what
					lines of style.css you can edit easily, and what they'll do. Refer to
					the
					<a href="#anatomy">Anatomy of an Extension</a> section above as you
					begin making your edits to understand what file does what. That
					information is located in the project's README, so you can refer to
					that too.
				</p>
				<h4>Seeing Your Edits</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>In Mozilla Firefox,</strong> use
					<a
						href="https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/"
						target="_blank">
						this tutorial</a
					>
					to temporarily add an extension to your browser. Perfect for testing
					edits and making cosmetic changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're a <strong>Google Chrome</strong> user, you can follow
					<a
						href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked"
						target="_blank">
						this tutorial.
					</a>
				</p>
				<h4>Updating Your Extension</h4>
				<p>
					Updating your extension is going to follow the exact steps as the
					installation instructions above. Once you've made your changes and
					saved your files, make your ZIP folder (as explained in Step 5) and
					upload to your browser!
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2 class="section-header" id="extras">
				I Want to Know More About the Code!
			</h2>
			<div class="spacing">
				<p>
					My GitHub readme has some basic information about the extension- if
					you’re more code savvy you could edit and publish the extension only
					using the readme and comments in the code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Below is some additional information about how the code works, and a
					little bit about my thoughts behind certain design choices. If you
					disagree or think you could do something better- feel free! I’m
					<em> sure </em> there’s a way to make every line of code more
					efficient and more elegant.
				</p>
				<h3>General Design</h3>
				<p>
					I only wanted the most recent update visible in the extension- mainly
					because there isn’t a backend so there’s no way for you to ‘delete’ an
					RSS update and have that stay deleted every time you open the
					extension. Also, I thought only having the most recent update would
					keep the extension from getting cluttered if you followed multiple
					webcomics.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also chose to populate the information into a table- both of these
					are things someone with coding experience could change and mess around
					with. Whether changing if the RSS populates into a p element rather
					than a table, or loading more than one update per webcomic. Go wild-
					honestly- and then show me!
				</p>
				<h3>Manifest Version 2</h3>
				<p>
					I used a V2 manifest, which may have been a huge mistake. This is
					mostly because I mainly developed the extension in Firefox, and then
					realized Chrome is discontinuing V2. Right now, they aren’t allowing
					new extensions in the Web Store that use V2, but you can still upload
					them from a file. I’ll probably do some work to get the extension to
					v3, but right now it’s not there. If you’re a Chrome user, I’ll tweet
					and make an update when I switch everything to manifest version 3. But
					for now… We’ll see. They have postponed the deprecation timelines, so
					it seems like the current code will probably work for the rest of
					2023, at least.
				</p>
				<h3>CORS</h3>
				<p>
					Ah, CORS. This was the first big hurdle when I was creating the RSS
					Feed Reader. (For those who may not know: CORS stands for Cross Origin
					Resource Sharing, and protects a website’s assets. This includes an
					RSS feed. Some sites allow an external RSS Feed Reader to access the
					RSS Feed, some don’t.) All the webcomic RSS feeds I tried to access
					didn’t let me access them. Very irritating.
				</p>
				<p>
					However! After some research, I found
					<a href="https://corsproxy.io/" target="_blank">corsproxy.io</a> It
					fixes and resolves the CORS errors I was seeing, and is very easy to
					implement in your own work. Honestly, I’m not 100% sure how it works
					or who made it- clicking through the site, it appears to be from a
					German company. But it works!
