    <h1>Happy Webcomics Day!</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>Webcomics (to me) are heavily DIY- artists and writers choosing to take stories into their
      own hands and publishing it for anyone who is interested (often for free).
      Say something nice about how an RSS feeds, explain how they're used. Make a comment about social media burying artists.</p>
    <p>There's a lot of great RSS Feed Reader extensions you can download for your browser, but in the DIY spirit- here is an RSS Feed Reader extension, <em>you</em>
    create, you edit, and that you can customize to your heart's content. Did you know that browser extensions can be made using
    good old HTML and CSS? Yeah! <em>You</em> can customize your own RSS Feed Reader! Easily!</p>
    
    Three buttons - one says "i don't know anything about coding!" one says "Take me to the download" and one says 
      "I want to know more!"
    <h3>Take Me to the Code!</h3>
    <p>Download Link</p>
    <h4>What to Edit</h4>
    <p>With screenshots of code, etc.</p>
    <h4>Downloading</h4>
    <p>How to Add to your Browser (2 column based on Mozilla vs. Chrome)</p>
    <h3>I Want to Know More of What's Under the Hood!</h3>
    <p>Thanks to Screentones for putting together Webcomics day!</p>
