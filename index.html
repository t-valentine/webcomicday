      <p>Webcomics (to me) are heavily DIY- artists and writers choosing to take stories into their
        own hands and publishing it for anyone who is interested (often for free).

      create, you edit, and that you can customize to your heart's content. Did you know that browser extensions can be made using
      good old HTML and CSS? Yeah! <em>You</em> can customize your own RSS Feed Reader! Easily!</p>
